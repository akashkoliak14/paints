<h1>Great Things Start Small</h1>


    <center>
    The company has come a long way since its small beginnings in 1942. 
    <br />
    It was set up as a partnership firm by four friends who were willing 
    <br />
    to take on the world's biggest, most famous paint companies operating 
    <br />
    in India at that time. Over the course of 25 years, Asian Paints becamebr   
    <br /> a corporate force and India's leading paints company. Driven by its 
    <br />     strong consumer-focus and innovative spirit, the company has been 
    <br />
    the market leader in paints since 1967. Today, it is double the size of any 
    <br />
    other paint company in India. Asian Paints manufactures a wide range of paints 
    <br />
    for decorative and industrial use.
